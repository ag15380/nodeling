# nodeling
A small app to demonstrate Node.js/Express and node-sqlite3. 

## Objective
Proof-of-concept project showing:
 * Node.js as the core app engine
 * Express.js as the web framework
 * node-sqlite3 as the database API
 * Some basic DDL/DML
 
## Usage
This app is packaged *without* its dependencies. 

To install them, use Node.js command prompt and run:
> npm install

Then, start the app.js by running
> node app.js

Assuming it all worked, you can use the app at http://localhost:3000
